[ABOUT NOVIC]
Novic Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to building affordable high-tech prosthetic limbs powered by intelligent embedded chips to help economically challenged disabled individuals regain natural motion, dignity, and independence.

[THE PROBLEM]
- Advanced prosthetics are expensive and inaccessible for poor individuals.
- Low-cost prosthetics often lack smooth, natural movement.
- Disabled individuals from rural and low-income communities struggle the most.
- Movement and mobility directly impact dignity, employment, and life freedom.

[WHAT WE ARE DEVELOPING]

HARDWARE
- AI-driven prosthetic arms and legs
- 3D-printed lightweight limb frames for custom fit
- Myoelectric EMG muscle sensors for motion intent
- IMU chips (accelerometer + gyroscope) for limb orientation
- Microcontroller chip (brain of prosthetic: signals → movement)
- Motor driver ICs for smooth actuator control
- Edge AI chip for instant movement prediction (offline capability)
- Haptic feedback modules for touch/pressure simulation
- Modular parts for easy, low-cost repairs
- Waterproof and dust-resistant casing for rural use

SOFTWARE
- Prosthetic control firmware (embedded chip software)
- AI movement-prediction models for natural motion
- Auto-calibration and sensitivity tuning per user
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication: chip ↔ mobile app
- Safety freeze and idle-lock during error states
- Mobile companion app for:
    • Speed control  
    • Sensor sensitivity tuning  
    • Movement mode switching  
    • Battery and chip diagnostics  
- Optional cloud backup of personalized movement profile
